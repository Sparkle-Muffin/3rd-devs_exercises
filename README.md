# Python POST

## Overview

This is a simple Python project made solely for the purposes of AI_devs 3 course. It enables sending JSON files by a POST method.

## Description

The project consists of the following files:

*  send_json.py - send_json() function sends JSON file to a specified url.
* /tasks/task_X/task.py - The functions in those files are responsible for performing actions specified in a given task. For example, in the task_0, the exercise is to download 2 strings from a given url, save them in a JSON file, and send this file to another url. The JSON file is created in the same directory.
* .env - You should create this file in a root directory of your project. 
Inside it, you should place your API_KEY in the following manner: API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX". Don't show this file to anyone - it is listed in the .gitignore by default.
