# EXAMPLE_1:
There can be references to some significant historical events, like:
    "Musimy cofnąć się do początków tej technologii. Od tego się zaczęło."
    ...
    "Pierwszy iPhone to rok 2007."
    ...
    "W iPhone 5S dodano czytnik linii papilarnych. (było to w roku 2013)."
    ...

If there is no straight answer in the text, refer to the events mentioned nearby in the text. 
For the question:
    "Który rok ma autor na myśli wspominając o początkach technologii?"
You should find and combine all useful information and answer:
    "Autor ma na myśli rok 2007."

# EXAMPLE_2:
There can be references to Sigla/Siglum, like:
    "Ps 23, 4"

You have to replace "Ps 23, 4" Sigla with its content.: "Chociażbym chodził ciemną DOLINĄ, zła się nie ulęknę, bo Ty jesteś ze mną. Twój kij i Twoja laska są tym, co mnie pociesza.".
For the question:
    "W jakie miejsce na przechadzkę wybrał się Janusz?"
You should find and combine all useful information and answer using the original term (in this case: DOLINA), not some adjectives like "głęboka", "niebezpieczna", etc.:
    "Janusz wybrał się na przechadzkę do DOLINY."
