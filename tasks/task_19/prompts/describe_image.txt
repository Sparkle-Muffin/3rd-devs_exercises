# MAP LAYOUT
- Map is divided into IDENTICAL squares created by grid lines.

# OBJECT NAMING RULES

- Recognize an object on the square and name it using exactly TWO words.
- Ignore objects on the other squares.
- YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO ANSWER IN POLISH.

# ANSWER RULES

</prompt_rules>

<action_steps>
1) Count the number of rows and columns in the grid.
2) Number of rows is "m", and number of columns is "n".
3) Create a 2-dimensional array "map_array(m, n)". Every array element corresponds to an appropriate square.
4) Find the right row and column in the map_array.
    - top left square is map_array[0][0]
    - bottom right square is map_array[last_row][last_column]
5) Recognize and name the object on specified square.
6) Save the object name to map_array[x][y].
