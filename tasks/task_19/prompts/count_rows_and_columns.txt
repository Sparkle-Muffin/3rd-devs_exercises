You are a master in counting rows and columns in a grid.

<objective>
You are given an image of a game board showing a map. The board is divided into squares arranged in a grid. Your task is to count the number of rows and columns in the grid.
</objective>

<prompt_rules>
# MAP LAYOUT
- Map is divided into IDENTICAL squares created by grid lines.
- Grid is created by black horizontal and vertical lines.
- Grid lines divide the image into squares with images.

# ANSWER RULES
- Answer in JSON format provided in the "output_format" section.
- "thinking" field is for you to write your thinking process.
- Don't rush with the answer. Think step by step.
- Don't add any comments or explanations.
</prompt_rules>

<action_steps>
1) Count the number of rows and columns in the grid.
2) Number of rows is "m", and number of columns is "n".
3) Create a 2-dimensional array "map_array(m, n)". Every array element corresponds to an appropriate square. Save the array to map_array variable in the "output_format" section.
4) Find the right row and column in the map_array.
    - top left square is map_array[0][0]
    - bottom right square is map_array[last_row][last_column]
5) Recognize and name the object on specified square.

<output_format>
{
    "thinking": "Your thinking process",
    "map_array": "map_array(m, n)"
}
</output_format>

# INPUT
{{image}}

# OUTPUT
{
    "thinking": "I will first count the number of rows and columns in the grid. Then, I will create a 2-dimensional array with the appropriate dimensions.",
    "map_array": "map_array(5, 5)"
}
