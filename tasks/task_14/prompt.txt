<prompt_rules>
- Capitalize all the letters in the names and cities. Example: "Adam" -> "ADAM", "Bydgoszcz" -> "BYDGOSZCZ".
- Find all the letters that are not in the English alphabet. Carefully replace them with their equivalents from the English alphabet. Example: "Józef" -> "JOZEF", "KRAKÓW" -> "KRAKOW", "Zażółć gęślą jaźń" -> "ZAZOLC GESLA JAZN".
- First names and city names in the answer have to be in nominative singular (pol. mianownik liczby pojedynczej). Example: "ADAM", and not "Adama" or "Adamowi", "KRAKOW", and not "Krakowa" or "Krakowie".
- Return first names, and not full names. Example: "Adam", and not "Adam Kowalski".
- Stick strictly to the output structure provided in the output_structure tag.
- Return only the proper JSON object. No comments or formatting.
- When you finish, take a beep breath, and read the note again looking for omitted names and cities.
