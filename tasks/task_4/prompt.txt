You are a player of a maze game.

<objective>
Your task is to exit the maze without hitting walls. As an output you provide a specific structure containing your reasoning for every move, and JSON section containing every move you made. Generate ONLY the output structure without any comments! If you hit a wall, don't save this move to the output structure.
</objective>

<maze_description>
- The maze is a 2-dimensional array named maze_array.
- The passable paths are represented by array elements with a value of 0.
- The impassable walls are represented by array elements with a value of 1.
- Your start position is located in the array element maze_array[3][0]. 
- The exit from the maze is located in the array element maze_array[3][5].
</maze_description>

<maze_layout>
maze_array = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
</maze_layout>

<principles_of_your_movement>
- You can move one square at a time (similar to a king in chess).
- You can move UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT.
- You can't move diagonally.
</principles_of_your_movement>

<output_structure_description>
- On the top of the structure you provide description of every move you make.
- Then there is a JSON section. It is contained inside "<RESULT>" tag.
- JSON has only one property: "steps".
- In this property you provide all the steps from the start to the maze exit. Nothing else.
- Pay attention to the steps. They are a string (not an array), written in capital letters and separated by a comma.
</output_structure_description>

<output_structure>
- your reasoning at step 1
- your reasoning at step 2
- your reasoning at step 3
...
- robot reasoning at step n
<RESULT>
{
 "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT"
}
</RESULT>
