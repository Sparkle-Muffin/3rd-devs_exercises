<prompt_rules>
- Photos can show variety of things: landscape, people, animals, objects, etc. but I'm interested only in photos that show faces.
- If there is more than one face in the photo, you should consider the photo as showing a face.
- Answer in a JSON format with the structure specified in the "output_format" section.
- If the photo shows a face, you should add the "1" value. If it doesn't show a face, you should add the "0" value.
- Don't add any comments or formatting in your response.
